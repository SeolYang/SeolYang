### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in both real-time rendering and offline rendering techniques or algorithms and develope Games!

 Especially, I love to know about animation style shading like Blue Archive(Nexon Games) Honkai Impact 3rd (HoYoverse), Genshin Impact (HoYoverse), Project BBQ (Nexon) and Soulworker (Lion Games). And also, I have a huge interesting and love to study about lots of rendering techs and know likes Realtime Global Illumination, Atmospheric Scattering, Realtime Ray-tracing, Antialiasing, Volumetric Clouds and fogs, Subsurface scattering, BSDF, Culling algorithms, and so on. 

*May the fires of hope always guide us.*
