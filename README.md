### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in both real-time rendering and offline rendering techniques or algorithms and develope Games!

 Especially, I love to know about animation style shading like Blue Archive(Nexon Games), Honkai Impact 3rd (HoYoverse), Genshin Impact (HoYoverse), Closers(Nexon) and Soulworker (Lion Games). And also, I have a huge interesting and love to study about lots of rendering techs like Realtime/Offline Global Illumination Algorithms, Atmospheric Scattering, Antialiasing schemes, Volumetric Clouds and fogs, Subsurface scattering, BSDFs, BSSRDFs, Culling algorithms, and so on. 

*May the fires of hope always guide us.*
